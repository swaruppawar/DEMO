 Method Overloading ___________

    a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

          If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.

 Example_______

 class Adder
   {  
     static int add(int a,int b){return a+b;}  
     static int add(int a,int b,int c){return a+b+c;}  
   } 
 
  class TestOverloading1{  

     public static void main(String[] args){  
     System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11));  
     System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11,11));  
}}
